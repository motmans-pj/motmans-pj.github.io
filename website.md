# About Me

I am an aspiring data scientist/machine learning engineer. I will graduate from the Msc in Data Sciences and Business Analytics at ESSEC Business School and CentraleSupelec in February. 

Apart from that, I am interested in the societal impact of different technologies. This has led me to a role as editor of Metalab Ideas, a student-led think thank where I have published articles about  [*Walled Gardens in the Metaverse*](https://metalab.essec.edu/walled-gardens/) and [*AI Alignment*](https://metalab.essec.edu/social-scientists-in-the-quest-for-ai-alignment-the-potential-of-interdisciplinary-collaboration-in-ai-safety/). Before moving to Paris, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Business Engineering at the University of Antwerp.

Before all of this, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Business Engineering at the University of Antwerp.
