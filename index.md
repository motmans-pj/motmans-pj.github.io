# About me

After graduating from high school, my interests were all over the place. I wanted to learn more about the inner workings of financial markets and different economic theories, while at the same time improving my knowledge of statistics and mathematics. The study of these different fields during my Bachelor's in Business Engineering was an invaluable experience. Throughout these years, I discovered a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence. This interest has been evolving for several years now. At first, I approached AI using the knowledge of economics I had, and I wondered about the societal impact of the technology. What happened after that can be summarized by an ever-increasing call to study the mathematical and computer science aspects of AI. An evolution that has now led me to pursue research in the field of Reinforcement Learning.
